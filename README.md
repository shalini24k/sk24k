Train Shortest Path

This project is designed to find the shortest path between train stations using various algorithms. The implementation is written in Python and provides a robust solution for computing the shortest path in a graph representing train stations and routes.

Features:

Graph Representation: The train network is represented as a graph where nodes are stations and edges are routes between them.

Shortest Path Algorithms: Implements popular algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* for finding the shortest path.

Command Line Interface: Provides a CLI for users to input stations and get the shortest path.

Extensible: Easy to add more algorithms or modify existing ones

train.py: Main script to run the shortest path algorithms.

graph.py: Contains the graph representation and utility functions.

algorithms.py: Implements the shortest path algorithms.

requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
